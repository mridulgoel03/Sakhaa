# Sakhaa: Your AI Friend

Sakhaa is a chatbot program that listens to voice commands and performs various tasks such as playing music, writing in a diary, talking to the user, and answering questions. It leverages several Python libraries and the OpenAI API to enhance user interaction.

## Features

- **Voice Command Recognition**: Responds to specific voice commands.
- **Music Playback**: Plays a song based on the mood stored in `chosen_emotion.txt`.
- **Diary Entry**: Allows users to write diary entries.
- **Chat with Sakhaa**: Generates responses to user queries using the OpenAI API.
- **Exit Command**: Gracefully terminates the program.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the `start()` function in the `main.py` file. This will launch a graphical user interface (GUI) with an image of Sakhaa. 
2. **Automatic Closure**: The GUI window will automatically close after 3 seconds.
3. **Voice Commands**: After the window closes, the program will listen for voice commands. You can say:
   - **"listen to music"**: Plays a song based on your mood.
   - **"write in my diary"**: Opens a text file for diary entries.
   - **"talk to Sakha"**: Engages with the OpenAI API for responses.
   - **"exit"**: Stops the program.
